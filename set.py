# set:
# set is a container in which we contain multiple data, but 
# duplication is not allowed, and unordered datatype
# where our main concern is data, but not any order related to it,
# then we use set.
# collection of alphabet ---> super set
# a,e,i,o,u ----> subset

# A = {1,3,9,9,7,2,5}
# B = {2,3,99,11,99,5}
# A intersection B ---> {3,2,5}
# A union B ---> {1,7,9,3,2,5,99,11}
# A-B ---> {1,7,9}
# B-A ---> {99,11}
# intersection means common 
# union means both set
